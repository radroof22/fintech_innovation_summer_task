       "'Management\\x92s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\n This section and other parts of this Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements can\\nalso be identified by words such as \\x93anticipates,\\x94 \\x93expects,\\x94 \\x93believes,\\x94 \\x93plans,\\x94 \\x93predicts,\\x94 and similar terms. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the\\nCompany\\x92s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the subsection entitled \\x93Risk\\nFactors\\x94 above, which are incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item\\xa08 of this Form 10-K. All information presented\\nherein is based on the Company\\x92s fiscal calendar. Unless otherwise stated, references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to the Company\\x92s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters of those fiscal years.\\nThe Company assumes no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason, except as required by law.  Executive Overview\\n The Company designs, manufactures, and markets personal computers, portable digital music players, and mobile communication devices and sells a variety\\nof related software, services, peripherals, and networking solutions. The Company\\x92s products and services include the Mac line of desktop and portable computers, the iPod line of portable digital music players, iPhone, Apple TV, Xserve, a\\nportfolio of consumer and professional software applications, the Mac OS X operating system, third-party digital content through the iTunes Store, and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells its products worldwide\\nthrough its online stores, its retail stores, its direct sales force, and third-party wholesalers, retailers, and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Mac, iPod and iPhone compatible products, including\\napplication software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and various other accessories and peripherals through its online and retail stores. The Company sells to consumer, small and mid-sized business (\\x93SMB\\x94), education,\\nenterprise, government, and creative markets.  \\xa0\\n36 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nThe Company is focused on providing innovative products and solutions to consumer, SMB, education, enterprise, government\\nand creative customers that greatly enhance their evolving digital lifestyles. The Company is the only participant in the personal computer and consumer electronics industries that controls the design and development of the entire personal computer,\\nincluding the hardware, operating system, and sophisticated software applications, as well as the design and development of portable digital music players, mobile communication devices, and a variety of products and solutions for obtaining and\\nenjoying digital content. The Company is therefore uniquely positioned to offer superior and well-integrated digital lifestyle products and solutions, which are further enhanced by the Company\\x92s emphasis on ease-of-use and creative industrial\\ndesigns.  The Company participates in several highly competitive markets, including personal computers with its Mac line of personal computers, consumer\\nelectronics with its iPod product families, mobile communications with iPhone, and distribution of third-party digital content through its online iTunes Store. While the Company is widely recognized as a leading innovator in the personal computer\\nand consumer electronics markets as well as a leader in the emerging market for distribution of digital content, these markets are highly competitive and subject to aggressive pricing. To remain competitive, the Company believes that increased\\ninvestment in research and development and marketing and advertising is necessary to maintain or expand its position in the markets where it competes. The Company\\x92s R&D spending is focused on further developing its existing Mac line of\\npersonal computers, its operating system, application software, iPhone and iPods; developing new digital lifestyle consumer and professional software applications; and investing in new product areas and technologies. The Company also believes\\nincreased investment in marketing and advertising programs is critical to increasing product and brand awareness.  The Company utilizes a variety of direct\\nand indirect distribution channels. The Company believes that sales of its innovative and differentiated products are enhanced by knowledgeable salespersons who can convey the value of the hardware, software, and peripheral integration, demonstrate\\nthe unique digital lifestyle solutions that are available only on Mac computers, and demonstrate the compatibility of the Mac with the Windows platform and networks. The Company further believes providing a high-quality sales and after-sales support\\nexperience is critical to attracting new and retaining existing customers. To ensure a high-quality buying experience for its products in which service and education are emphasized, the Company continues to expand and improve its distribution\\ncapabilities by opening its own retail stores in the U.S. and internationally. The Company had 247 stores open as of September\\xa027, 2008.  The Company\\nhas also invested in programs to enhance reseller sales, including the Apple Sales Consultant Program, which places Apple employees and contractors at selected third-party reseller locations. The Company believes providing direct contact with its\\ntargeted customers is an efficient way to demonstrate the advantages of its Mac computers and other products over those of its competitors.\\xa0The Company also sells to customers directly through its online stores around the world and through its\\ndirect sales force.  The Company\\x92s iPods are sold through a significant number of distribution points to provide broad access. iPods can be purchased\\nin certain department stores, member-only warehouse stores, large retail chains, and specialty retail stores, as well as through the channels for Mac distribution listed above.  iPhone is distributed through the Company, its cellular network carriers\\x92 distribution channels, and certain third-party resellers. The Company has signed multi-year agreements with various cellular network\\ncarriers authorizing them to distribute and provide cellular network services for iPhone 3G in over 70 countries. These agreements are generally not exclusive with a specific carrier, except in the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Ireland, and\\ncertain other countries. The Company expects to ship iPhone 3G in over 70 countries by the end of calendar year 2008.  Critical Accounting Policies and\\nEstimates  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the\\nCompany\\x92s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company\\x92s management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts \\n \\xa0\\n37 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nreported in its Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 \\x93Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\x94 of Notes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company\\x92s Consolidated Financial Statements. Management bases its estimates on historical experience\\nand on various other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates and\\nsuch differences may be material.  Management believes the Company\\x92s critical accounting policies and estimates are those related to revenue\\nrecognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation and inventory purchase commitments, warranty costs, stock-based compensation, income taxes, and legal and other contingencies. Management considers these policies critical because\\nthey are both important to the portrayal of the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters. The Company\\x92s senior management has\\nreviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of the Company\\x92s Board of Directors.  Revenue Recognition  Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, music products, digital content,\\nperipherals, and service and support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue for software products (operating system software and applications software), or any product that is considered to be software-related, in accordance with the guidance in\\nEmerging Issues Task Force (\\x93EITF\\x94) No.\\xa003-5, Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing More-Than-Incidental Software, (e.g., Mac computers, iPod portable\\ndigital music players and iPhone) pursuant to American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (\\x93AICPA\\x94) Statement of Position (\\x93SOP\\x94) No.\\xa097-2, Software Revenue Recognition, as amended. For products that are not\\nsoftware or software-related, (e.g., digital content sold on the iTunes Store and certain Mac, iPod and iPhone supplies and accessories), the Company recognizes revenue pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (\\x93SEC\\x94) Staff\\nAccounting Bulletin (\\x93SAB\\x94) No.\\xa0104, Revenue Recognition.  The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement\\nexists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the\\nCompany\\x92s product sales, these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U.S., and for certain other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer\\nreceives the product because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during transit. If at the outset of an arrangement the Company determines the arrangement fee is not, or is presumed not to be, fixed or determinable,\\nrevenue is deferred and subsequently recognized as amounts become due and payable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met.  For both\\nApple TV and iPhone, the Company has indicated that from time-to-time it may provide future unspecified features and additional software products free of charge to customers. Therefore, sales of Apple TV and iPhone handsets are recognized under\\nsubscription accounting in accordance with SOP No.\\xa097-2. The Company recognizes the associated revenue and cost of goods sold on a straight-line basis over the currently estimated 24-month economic lives of these products, with any loss\\nrecognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred by the Company for engineering, sales, marketing, and warranty are expensed as incurred.  The Company records\\nreductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to price protection and for customer incentive programs, including reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and volume-based incentives. For transactions involving price\\nprotection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated amount to be refunded, provided the refund amount can be reasonably and reliably estimated and the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. The Company\\x92s policy\\nrequires that, if refunds cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is not recognized until reliable estimates can be made or the price protection lapses. For customer incentive programs, the estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later\\nof the date at \\n \\xa0\\n38 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nwhich the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future\\nproduct returns based on the Company\\x92s historical experience. Future market conditions and product transitions may require the Company to increase customer incentive programs and incur incremental price protection obligations that could result\\nin additional reductions to revenue at the time such programs are offered. Additionally, certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience\\nand the specific terms and conditions of particular incentive programs. If a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives, the Company would be required to record additional reductions to revenue, which would have a negative\\nimpact on the Company\\x92s results of operations.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The Company distributes its products through third-party distributors and resellers and directly to certain education, consumer, and enterprise customers. The Company generally does not require collateral from its\\ncustomers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers in Latin\\nAmerica, Europe, Asia, and Australia and by arranging with third-party financing companies to provide flooring arrangements and other loan and lease programs to the Company\\x92s direct customers. These credit-financing arrangements are directly\\nbetween the third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit-risk-sharing related to any of these arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables that are not covered by\\ncollateral, third-party flooring arrangements, or credit insurance are outstanding with the Company\\x92s distribution and retail channel partners.  The\\nallowance for doubtful accounts is based on management\\x92s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers. The Company records\\nan allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that it reasonably believes to be collectible. The Company also records an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors, including historical experience with bad\\ndebts, the general economic environment, the financial condition of the Company\\x92s distribution channels, and the aging of such receivables. If there is a deterioration of a major customer\\x92s financial condition, if the Company becomes aware\\nof additional information related to the credit-worthiness of a major customer, or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated, the Company may have to adjust its allowance for doubtful\\naccounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.  Inventory Valuation and Inventory Purchase Commitments  The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and\\nproducts, including third-party products held for resale, which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value. The Company performs a detailed review of inventory each fiscal quarter that considers multiple\\nfactors including demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, and component cost trends. The personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communications industries are subject to a rapid and\\nunpredictable pace of product and component obsolescence and demand changes. If future demand or market conditions for the Company\\x92s products are less favorable than forecasted or if unforeseen technological changes negatively impact the\\nutility of component inventory, the Company may be required to record additional write-downs, which would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the write-downs were recorded.  The Company accrues reserves for estimated cancellation fees related to component orders that have been cancelled or are expected to be cancelled. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components\\nthrough a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. These commitments typically cover the Company\\x92s requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. If there is an abrupt and\\nsubstantial decline in demand for one or more of the Company\\x92s products or an unanticipated change in technological requirements for any of the Company\\x92s products, the Company may be required to record additional reserves for cancellation\\nfees that would negatively affect gross margins in the period when the cancellation fees are identified and recorded.  \\xa0\\n39 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nWarranty Costs  The\\nCompany provides for the estimated cost for hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized based on historical and projected warranty claim rates, historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific\\nproduct failures that are outside of the Company\\x92s typical experience. Each quarter, the Company reevaluates its estimates to assess the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities considering the size of the installed base of products\\nsubject to warranty protection and adjusts the amounts as necessary. For products accounted for under subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No.\\xa097-2, the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred.\\xa0If actual product failure rates or\\nrepair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and could negatively affect the Company\\x92s results of operations.  The Company periodically provides updates to its applications and operating system software to maintain the software\\x92s compliance with specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is accounted for\\nas warranty cost that is recognized at the time related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to occur,\\nand the historical cost and estimated future cost of the resources necessary to develop these updates.  Stock-Based Compensation  The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (\\x93SFAS\\x94) No.\\xa0123 (revised 2004),\\nShare-Based Payment. Under the provisions of SFAS No.\\xa0123R, stock-based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award\\x92s fair-value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton (\\x93BSM\\x94) option-pricing\\nmodel and is recognized as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The BSM option-pricing model requires various judgmental assumptions including expected volatility, forfeiture rates, and expected option life.\\nSignificant changes in any of these assumptions could materially affect the fair value of stock-based awards granted in the future.   Income\\nTaxes  The Company records a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with SFAS\\nNo.\\xa0109, Accounting for Income Taxes, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary\\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable\\nincome in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. Effective at\\nthe beginning of 2008, the Company adopted Financial Interpretation No. (\\x93FIN\\x94) 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\\x97an interpretation of FASB Statement No.\\xa0109. Further information may be found in Note 5,\\n\\x93Income Taxes\\x94 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K.  Management believes it is more likely than not that\\nforecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. In the\\nevent that the Company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future, the Company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made.\\nIn addition, the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of FIN 48 and other complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with\\nmanagement\\x92s expectations could have a material impact on the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results.  Legal and Other\\nContingencies  As discussed in Part I, Item\\xa03 of this Form 10-K under the heading \\x93Legal Proceedings\\x94 and in Note 8 \\x93Commitments and\\nContingencies\\x94 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is subject to \\n \\xa0\\n40 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nvarious legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No.\\xa05, Accounting for Contingencies,\\nthe Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be\\nreasonably estimated. In management\\x92s opinion, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial\\ncondition or operating results. However, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company are subject to significant uncertainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal matters or should several of these\\nlegal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected.  Net Sales  Fiscal years 2008 and 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. An additional week is\\nincluded in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters.  The following table summarizes net\\nsales and Mac unit sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product during the three fiscal years ended September\\xa027, 2008 (in millions,

NM =\\nNot Meaningful  Fiscal Year 2008 versus 2007  Net sales during 2008 increased 35% or $8.5 billion from 2007. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Mac net sales increased $4.0 billion or 38% during 2008 compared to 2007, while Mac unit sales increased by 2.7\\xa0million units or 38%. Net sales related to the\\nCompany\\x92s Mac shipments accounted for 44% of the Company\\x92s total net revenue. Higher Mac unit sales, which contributed to the increases in net sales, were driven by higher sales of all of the Company\\x92s portable products as well as the\\npopularity of the iMac, which experienced strong growth in net sales and unit sales in all of the Company\\x92s reportable segments. Unit sales of the Company\\x92s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company\\x92s personal computer\\nshipments in both 2008 and 2007. Net sales and unit sales of the Company\\x92s portable products both increased by 38% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was attributable to strong demand for all the portable products, particularly the\\nMacBook, which had double-digit growth in all of the Company\\x92s operating segments, and the addition of the MacBook Air, which was introduced to the Company\\x92s portable product line in January 2008. Growth of the Company\\x92s desktop\\nsystems was also strong, with increased net sales and unit sales of 39% and 37%, respectively, during 2008 due primarily to strong sales of the iMac in all of the Company\\x92s operating segments.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of iPods increased $848 million or 10% during 2008 compared to 2007 whereas unit sales of iPods increased 6% compared to 2007. The iPod unit growth was\\ndue to strong demand for the iPod touch, and to a lesser extent, higher unit sales of the iPod shuffle due to a price reduction in February 2008. iPod net sales grew faster than iPod unit sales due to higher average selling prices caused by a shift\\nin overall iPod product mix to the higher priced iPod touch.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $1.8 billion for 2008, with iPhone handset unit sales totaling 11.6 million. During 2008, sales of iPhone\\nexpanded beyond the U.S. and the Company expects to be shipping iPhones in over 70 countries by the end of December 2008. Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007, which represented sales for one fiscal\\nquarter. iPhone net sales include the portion of handset revenue recognized in accordance with subscription accounting over the product\\x92s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as revenue from sales of iPhone accessories and from carrier\\nagreements.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of other music related products and services increased $844 million or 34% during the 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to significantly increased net\\nsales from the iTunes Store in each of the Company\\x92s geographic segments. The Company believes this success is the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading third-party digital content, the expansion of third-party audio and video\\ncontent available for sale and rent via the iTunes Store, and the launch of the iTunes App Store. The Company continues to expand its iTunes content offerings around the world.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $399 million or 32% compared to 2007 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware\\naccessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays.  \\xa0\\n42 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $699 million or 46% during 2008 compared to 2007. This growth was due in large part to increased sales of\\nApple-branded and third-party developers\\x92 software products and increased net sales of AppleCare Protection Plan (\\x93APP\\x94) extended service and support contracts.  Fiscal Year 2007 versus 2006  Net sales during 2007 increased\\n24% or $4.7 billion from 2006 even though fiscal year 2007 spanned 52 weeks while fiscal year 2006 spanned 53 weeks. Several factors contributed to these increases including the following:  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Mac net sales increased $3 billion or 40% during 2007 compared to 2006, while Mac unit sales increased by 1.75\\xa0million units or 33%. The 33% Mac unit sales\\ngrowth rate is significantly greater than the estimated growth rate of the overall personal computer industry during that timeframe. Unit sales of the Company\\x92s portable products accounted for 62% of the Company\\x92s personal computer\\nshipments in 2007, up from 54% in 2006. Net sales and unit sales of the Company\\x92s portable products increased 55% and 51%, respectively, during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was due to strong demand for the MacBook, which increased in each\\nof the Company\\x92s operating segments, as well as the MacBook Pro, which increased in each operating segment except Japan. Mac desktop net sales and unit sales increased by 21% and 12%, respectively, during 2007 due to stronger sales of the iMac\\nin each of the Company\\x92s operating segments. The Mac desktop net sales growth was greater than the unit sales growth due primarily to a shift in desktop product mix away from the lower-price Mac Mini and discontinued eMac and toward the iMac.\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of iPods increased $629 million or 8% during 2007 compared to 2006. Unit sales of iPods increased 31% compared to 2006. The iPod growth was driven\\nprimarily by increased sales of the iPod shuffle and iPod nano particularly in international markets. iPod unit sales growth was significantly greater than iPod net sales due to a shift in overall iPod product mix, as well as due to lower selling\\nprices for the iPod classic, iPod nano and iPod shuffle in 2007 compared to 2006.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of iPhone and related products and services were $123 million in 2007. iPhone net sales include the portion of iPhone handset revenue recognized in\\naccordance with subscription accounting over the product\\x92s 24-month estimated economic life, as well as sales of iPhone accessory products and revenue from carrier agreements. iPhone unit sales were 1.39\\xa0million in 2007.\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of other music related products and services increased $611 million or 32% during 2007 compared to 2006 due to increased net sales from the iTunes Store.\\nThe Company believes this growth was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of peripherals and other hardware increased $160 million or 15% compared to 2006 due to an increase in wireless networking products and other hardware\\naccessories, including printers and scanners, which was partially offset by a decrease in net sales of displays.  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\x95\\n\\xa0\\n Net sales of software, service, and other sales rose $229 million or 18% during 2007 compared to 2006. This growth was attributable primarily to increased net sales\\nof APP extended service and support contracts and increased sales of Apple branded and third-party developers\\x92 software products.  Segment Operating Performance  The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company\\x92s reportable operating\\nsegments consist of the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Retail. The Americas, Europe, and Japan reportable segments do not include activities related to the Retail segment. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment\\nincludes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Retail segment operates Apple-owned retail stores in the U.S. and in international markets. Each reportable geographic operating segment and the Retail operating segment provide\\nsimilar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company\\x92s operating segments may be found in Note 9, \\x93Segment Information and Geographic Data\\x94 in Notes to Consolidated Financial\\nStatements of this Form 10-K.  \\xa0\\n43 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nAmericas  During\\n2008, net sales in the Americas segment increased $3.0 billion or 26% compared to 2007. The primary drivers of this growth were the significant year-over-year increase in sales of the iPod touch, Mac portable systems, content from the iTunes Store,\\nand iPhone. The Company began shipping iPhone in June 2007 and the growth in iPhone sales in 2008 resulted from a full year of iPhone shipments. The increase in Mac net sales of $1.3 billion or 30% and Mac unit sales of 961\\xa0million or 32% is\\nattributable to growth in all of the Mac portable systems, particularly the MacBook, and higher sales of the iMac. Net sales of iPods increased due to a shift in product mix toward higher priced iPods, particularly the iPod touch, which was upgraded\\nin June 2008. In 2008, the Americas segment represented 45% of the Company\\x92s total net sales as compared to 48% in the same period of 2007.

Net sales from the higher education market grew 15% during 2008 compared to 2007, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 12% during the same period.  During 2007, net sales in the Americas segment increased $2.2 billion, or 23%, compared to 2006. The main sources of this growth were Mac portable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the\\niTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of the MacBook, introduced in May 2006 and updated in May 2007, as well as the MacBook Pro, introduced in January 2006 and updated in June 2007. Sales of iMacs grew due to\\na shift in desktop product mix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle and the\\nintroduction of the iPod touch in September 2007. During 2007, the Americas segment represented 48% of the Company\\x92s total net sales as compared to 49% in the same period of 2006. During 2007, U.S. education channel net sales and Mac unit sales\\nincreased by 14% and 18%, respectively, compared to 2006. Net sales from the higher education market grew 17% during 2007 compared to 2006, while net sales in the K-12 market grew 10% during the same period.  Europe  For 2008, net sales and unit sales in Europe increased 40%\\nand 39%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2007. The main drivers of this growth were strong sales of Mac portable systems and iMac, increased sales from the iTunes Store, and iPhone. Also contributing to the increase in net sales were\\nhigher iPod net sales due primarily to the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the MacBook Pro and the MacBook, both updated in February 2008, as well as the MacBook Air, introduced in January\\n2008. Mac desktop sales also increased due primarily to the popularity of the iMac, which was updated in April 2008. Sales from the iTunes Store grew substantially by 79% from 2007 as a result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital\\ncontent and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store. The Europe segment represented 23% of total net sales in 2008, consistent with 2007.  Europe segment net sales increased $1.4 billion or 33% during 2007 compared to 2006. Consistent with the Americas segment, the primary drivers of this growth were Mac\\nportable products, iMacs, iPods, and the sales of third-party content from the iTunes Store. Sales of Mac portable products increased due to the popularity of both the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Sales of iMacs grew due to a shift in desktop product\\nmix away from the Mac mini and discontinued eMac as well as the strong reception of the new iMac introduced in August 2007. Sales of iPods grew due primarily to increased demand for the iPod nano and iPod shuffle. The Company believes that the\\ngrowth in iTunes Store sales was the result of heightened consumer interest in downloading digital content and the expansion of third-party audio and video content available for sale via the iTunes Store.  Japan  Japan net sales increased $427 million or 39% in 2008 compared\\nto 2007. The primary contributors to the growth in net sales were increases in sales of iPods, iMac, Mac portable systems, and strong sales from the iTunes Store. Net sales, unit sales and the average selling price of iPods increased during 2008\\ncompared to 2007, driven by strong demand for iPod touch and iPod nano. Additionally, Mac net sales and unit sales grew 42% and 29%, respectively, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to increase in sales of the iMac and Mac portable systems, particularly\\nMacBook, as well as the introduction of MacBook Air in January 2008.  \\xa0\\n44 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nJapan\\x92s net sales declined by $129 million or 11% in 2007 compared to 2006. Total Mac unit sales in Japan declined\\n1% during 2007. The decrease in the Japan segment\\x92s overall net sales was attributable primarily to decreases in iPod and Mac desktop sales, partially offset by an increase in revenue from MacBooks and sales of third-party content from the\\niTunes Store. The decline in net sales and Mac unit sales is partially attributable to Japan\\x92s declining consumer PC market, and the iPod sales decline is due primarily to lower average selling prices. The Company is continuing to evaluate ways\\nto improve the future results of its Japan segment.  Retail  Retail net sales grew by 53% during 2008 compared to 2007, due in large part to increased sales of Mac portable and desktop products, strong demand for the iPhone and iPod touch, and new store openings. The Company opened 50 new retail\\nstores during 2008, including a total of 19 international stores, bringing the total number of open stores to 247 as of September\\xa027, 2008. This compares to 197 open stores as of September\\xa029, 2007 and 165 open stores as of\\nSeptember\\xa030, 2006. With an average of 211 stores and 178 stores opened during 2008 and 2007, respectively, average revenue per store increased to $29.9 million for 2008, compared to $23.1 million in 2007.  Retail Mac net sales and Mac unit sales grew by 42% and 47%, respectively, during 2008 compared to the 2007, due primarily to strong demand for MacBook, iMac, and MacBook\\nAir, introduced in January 2008. Net sales of iPods increased due to the popularity of the iPod touch, which was upgraded in June 2008, and a higher average selling price compared to 2007. The higher iPod average selling price was due to strong\\ndemand for the iPod touch.  The Retail segment\\x92s net sales increased by 27% to $4.1 billion during 2007 compared to 2006. Retail segment Mac unit sales\\nincreased 56% during 2007 as compared to 2006. With an average of 178 stores open during 2007, average revenue per store was $23.1 million, compared to $22.9 million in 2006. The increase in Retail segment net sales during 2007 compared to 2006 was\\ndue primarily to stronger sales of Mac portable products, iMacs, accessories and services. The increase was partially offset primarily by lower net sales of iPods and other music related products due to the expanded availability of those products\\nthrough third-party resellers.  As measured by the Company\\x92s operating segment reporting, the Retail segment reported operating income of $1.3 billion\\nduring 2008 as compared to operating income of $875 million and $600 million during 2007 and 2006, respectively. This improvement in 2008 was attributable primarily to the significant Retail net sales growth of 53% as compared to 2007. \\nExpansion of the Retail segment has required and will continue to require a substantial investment in fixed assets and related infrastructure, operating lease\\ncommitments, personnel, and other operating expenses. Capital asset purchases associated with the Retail segment were $389 million in 2008, bringing the total capital asset purchases since inception of the Retail segment to $1.4 billion. As of\\nSeptember\\xa027, 2008, the Retail segment had approximately 15,900 full-time equivalent employees and had outstanding operating lease commitments associated with retail store space and related facilities of $1.4 billion. The Company would incur\\nsubstantial costs if it were to close multiple retail stores. Such costs could adversely affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results.  Other Segments  The Company\\x92s Other Segments, which consist of its Asia Pacific and FileMaker operations, experienced an increase in\\nnet sales of $707 million, or 40% during 2008 as compared to 2007. These increases are related primarily to strong growth in sales of all Mac portable systems, iPods, the iMac, and content from the iTunes Store in the Company\\x92s Asia Pacific\\nregion. Sales from the iTunes Store in the Company\\x92s Asia Pacific region grew significantly by 109% over 2007. Mac net sales and unit sales grew by 52% and 50%, respectively, due to increased sales of the iMac and all Mac portables. \\nThe Company\\x92s Other Segments experienced an increase in net sales of $406 million, or 30% during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase related primarily to a 58%\\nincrease in sales of Mac portable products and strong iPod sales in the Company\\x92s Asia Pacific region.  \\xa0\\n45 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nGross Margin  Gross\\nmargin for the three fiscal years ended September\\xa027, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except gross margin percentages):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2008\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2007\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2006\\n\\n Net sales\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa032,479\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa024,006\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa019,315\\n\\n Cost of sales\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n21,334\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n15,852\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n13,717\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Gross margin\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n11,145\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,154\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n5,598\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Gross margin percentage\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n34.3%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n34.0%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n29.0%\\n Gross margin percentage was relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007. Gross margin percentage of 34.0% in 2007\\nincreased significantly from 29.0% in 2006. The primary drivers of this increase were more favorable costs on certain commodity components, including NAND flash memory and DRAM memory, higher overall revenue that provided for more leverage on fixed\\nproduction costs and a higher percentage of revenue from the Company\\x92s direct sales channels.  The Company expects its gross margin percentage to\\ndecrease in future periods compared to levels achieved during 2008 and 2007, and anticipates gross margin levels of about 30% in 2009. This expected decline is due largely to the anticipated impact of product transitions, flat or reduced pricing on\\nnew and innovative products that have higher cost structures, both expected and potential future cost increases for key components, a stronger U.S. dollar, and higher logistical costs.  The foregoing statements regarding the Company\\x92s expected gross margin percentage are forward-looking and could differ from anticipated levels because of several factors, including but not limited to certain of\\nthose set forth below in Part I, Item\\xa01A, \\x93Risk Factors\\x94 under the subheading \\x93Future operating results depend upon the Company\\x92s ability to obtain key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash\\nmemory, DRAM and LCDs at favorable prices and in sufficient quantities,\\x94 which is incorporated herein by reference. There can be no assurance that targeted gross margin percentage levels will be achieved. In general, gross margins and\\nmargins on individual products will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions and\\nexpected increases in the cost of key components including, but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory, dynamic random access memory (\\x93DRAM\\x94) and liquid crystal displays (\\x93LCDs\\x94), as well as potential increases in the\\ncosts of outside manufacturing services and a potential shift in the Company\\x92s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to these competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take product pricing\\nactions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\\x92s ability to manage product quality and warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the\\nCompany\\x92s significant international operations, financial results can be significantly affected in the short-term by fluctuations in exchange rates.  Operating Expenses  Operating expenses for the three fiscal years ended September\\xa027, 2008, are as follows (in millions, except for\\npercentages):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2008\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n2007\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n2006\\n\\n Research and development\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,109\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n782\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n712\\n\\n Percentage of net sales\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.4%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.3%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n3.7%\\n\\n Selling, general, and administrative\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n3,761\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,963\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,433\\n\\n Percentage of net sales\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n11.6%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n12.3%\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n12.6%\\n Research and Development (\\x93R&D\\x94)  Expenditures for R&D increased 42% or $327 million to $1.1 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in\\nthe current year to support expanded R&D activities and higher stock-based compensation expenses. In 2008, $11 million of software development costs were capitalized \\n \\xa0\\n46 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nrelated to Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard and excluded from R&D expense, while R&D expense for 2007 excluded $75 million of capitalized software\\ndevelopment costs related to Mac OS X Leopard and iPhone. Although total R&D expense increased 42% during 2008, it remained relatively flat as a percentage of net sales given the 35% increase in revenue during 2008. The Company continues to\\nbelieve that focused investments in R&D are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company\\x92s core\\nbusiness strategy. As such, the Company expects to increase spending in R&D to remain competitive.  Expenditures for R&D increased 10% or $70\\nmillion to $782 million in 2007 compared to 2006. The increases in R&D expense were due primarily to an increase in R&D headcount in 2007 to support expanded R&D activities, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first\\nquarter of 2007 and the capitalized software development costs mentioned above.  Selling, General, and Administrative Expense (\\x93SG&A\\x94)\\n Expenditures for SG&A increased $798 million or 27% to $3.8 billion in 2008 compared to 2007. These increases are due primarily to higher\\nstock-based compensation expenses, higher variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales and the Company\\x92s continued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international\\nmarkets. In addition, the Company incurred higher spending on marketing and advertising during 2008 compared to 2007.  Expenditures for SG&A increased\\n$530 million or 22% during 2007 compared to 2006. The increase was due primarily to higher direct and indirect channel variable selling expenses resulting from the significant year-over-year increase in total net sales in 2007, the Company\\x92s\\ncontinued expansion of its Retail segment in both domestic and international markets, and higher spending on marketing and advertising, partially offset by one less week of expenses in the first quarter of 2007.  Other Income and Expense  Other income and expense for the three\\nfiscal years ended September\\xa027, 2008, are as follows (in millions):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2008\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2007\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n2006\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Interest income\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0653\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0647\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0394\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Other income (expense), net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(33\\n)\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(48\\n)\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n(29\\n)\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total other income and expense\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n620\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n599\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n$\\n365\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Total other income and expense increased $21 million to $620\\xa0million during 2008 as compared to $599 million\\nand $365 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. While the Company\\x92s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment balances increased by 59% in 2008, other income and expense increased only 4% due to the decline in the weighted average\\ninterest rate earned of 3.44%. The overall increase in other income and expense is attributable to the Company\\x92s higher cash and short-term investment balances, which more than offset the decline in interest rates during 2008 as compared to\\n2007. The weighted average interest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments was 5.27% and 4.58% during 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company had no debt outstanding and\\naccordingly did not incur any related interest expense.  Provision for Income Taxes  The Company\\x92s effective tax rates were 30% for the years ended September\\xa027, 2008 and September\\xa029, 2007, and 29% for the year ended September\\xa030, 2006. The Company\\x92s effective rates differ\\nfrom the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes are provided because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S.  As of September\\xa027, 2008, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $2.1 billion before being\\noffset against certain deferred liabilities for presentation on the Company\\x92s balance sheet. Management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income, including \\n \\xa0\\n47 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nincome that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities, will be\\nsufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets. The Company released a valuation allowance of $5 million since it has been determined that it is more likely than not the associated deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company\\nwill continue to evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance.  The Internal\\nRevenue Service (the \\x93IRS\\x94) has completed its field audit of the Company\\x92s federal income tax returns for the years 2002 through 2003 and proposed certain adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments through the\\nIRS Appeals Office. All IRS audit issues for years prior to 2002 have been resolved. In addition, the Company is subject to audits by state, local, and foreign tax authorities.\\xa0Management believes that adequate provision has been made for any\\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company\\x92s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\\x92s\\nexpectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in the period such resolution occurs.  Recent Accounting\\nPronouncements  In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\x93FASB\\x94) issued SFAS No.\\xa0157, Fair Value Measurements,\\nwhich defines fair value, provides a framework for measuring fair value, and expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. SFAS No.\\xa0157 applies to other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements; it does not\\nrequire any new fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (\\x93FSP\\x94) No. FAS 157-1, Application of FASB Statement No.\\xa0157 to FASB Statement No.\\xa013 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That\\nAddress Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease Classification or Measurement under Statement 13 and FSP No. FAS 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No.\\xa0157. FSP 157-1 amends SFAS No.\\xa0157 to remove certain leasing\\ntransactions from its scope. FSP\\xa0157-2 delays the effective date of SFAS\\xa0No.\\xa0157 to fiscal years beginning after November\\xa015, 2008 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized\\nor disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In October 2008, the FASB issued FSP No.\\xa0157-3, Determining the\\nFair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset is Not Active, to clarify the application of SFAS 157 in inactive markets for financial assets. FSP 157-3 became effective upon issuance and SFAS No.\\xa0157 is effective for fiscal\\nyears beginning after November\\xa015, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.\\xa0157, management does not currently believe\\nadoption will have a material impact on the Company\\x92s financial condition or operating results.  In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.\\xa0159,\\nThe Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\\x97including an amendment of FASB Statement No.\\xa0115. SFAS No.\\xa0159 allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at\\nfair value that are not required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No.\\xa0159 requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings at each reporting date. SFAS No.\\xa0159 is\\neffective for fiscal years beginning after November\\xa015, 2007 and will be adopted by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.\\xa0159, management does\\nnot currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company\\x92s financial condition or operating results.  In December 2007, the FASB\\nissued SFAS No.\\xa0141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed,\\nand any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination. SFAS No.\\xa0141R also establishes principles around how goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase should be recognized and measured, as\\nwell as provides guidelines on the disclosure requirements on the nature and financial impact of the business combination. SFAS No.\\xa0141R is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December\\xa015, 2008 and will be adopted by the\\nCompany beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.\\xa0141R, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact on the Company\\x92s financial\\ncondition or operating results.  \\xa0\\n48 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nIn March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No.\\xa0161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging\\nActivities\\x97an amendment of FASB Statement No.\\xa0133, which requires companies to provide additional disclosures about its objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, how the derivative instruments and related hedged items\\nare accounted for under SFAS No.\\xa0133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and related interpretations, and how the derivative instruments and related hedged items affect the Company\\x92s financial statements.\\nSFAS No.\\xa0161 also requires companies to disclose information about credit risk-related contingent features in their hedged positions. SFAS No.\\xa0161 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November\\xa015, 2008 and\\nis required to be adopted by the Company beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2009. Although the Company will continue to evaluate the application of SFAS No.\\xa0161, management does not currently believe adoption will have a material impact\\non the Company\\x92s financial condition or operating results.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  The following table presents selected financial information and statistics as of and for the three fiscal years ended September\\xa027, 2008 (in millions): \\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2008\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2007\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n2006\\n\\n Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa024,490\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa015,386\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa010,110\\n\\n Accounts receivable, net\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,422\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,637\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,252\\n\\n Inventory\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n509\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n346\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n270\\n\\n Working capital\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n20,598\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n12,676\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n8,066\\n\\n Annual operating cash flow\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n9,596\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n5,470\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n2,220\\n As of September\\xa027, 2008, the Company had $24.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments,\\nan increase of $9.1 billion from September\\xa029, 2007. The principal components of this net increase were cash generated by operating activities of $9.6 billion, proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans of $483 million and\\nexcess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $757 million. These increases were partially offset by payments for acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment of $1.1 billion, payments made in connection with business acquisitions, net of\\ncash acquired, of $220 million and payments for acquisitions of intangible assets of $108 million. The Company\\x92s cash generated by operating activities significantly exceeded its net income due primarily to the large increase in deferred\\nrevenue, net of deferred costs, associated with subscription accounting for iPhone.  The Company\\x92s short-term investment portfolio is invested\\nprimarily in highly rated securities with a minimum rating of single-A. As of September\\xa027, 2008 and September\\xa029, 2007, $11.3 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively, of the Company\\x92s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments\\nwere held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. The Company had $117 million in net unrealized losses on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities ranging from\\none to five years, as of September\\xa027, 2008, and net unrealized losses of approximately $11 million on its investment portfolio, primarily related to investments with stated maturities from one to five years, as of September\\xa029, 2007. The\\nCompany has\\xa0the intent and ability to hold such investments for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested. Accordingly,\\xa0none of these declines in fair value were recognized in the Company\\x92s\\nStatement of Operations. The Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to satisfy its\\nworking capital needs, capital expenditures, outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.  Capital Assets  The Company\\x92s cash payments for capital asset purchases were $1.1 billion during 2008,\\nconsisting of $389 million for retail store facilities and $702 million for real estate acquisitions and corporate infrastructure including information systems enhancements. The Company anticipates utilizing approximately $1.5 billion for capital\\nasset purchases during 2009, including approximately $400 million for Retail facilities and approximately $1.1 billion for corporate facilities and infrastructure.  \\xa0\\n49 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Company has not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby the Company has financial guarantees, subordinated retained interests, derivative\\ninstruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market\\nrisk, or credit risk support to the Company.  The following table presents certain payments due by the Company under contractual obligations with minimum\\nfirm commitments as of September\\xa027, 2008 and excludes amounts already recorded on the Company\\x92s balance sheet as current liabilities (in millions):  \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nTotal\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPayments\\xa0Duein LessThan 1 Year\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPaymentsDue in1-3 Years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPaymentsDue in4-5 Years\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\nPayments\\xa0Duein MoreThan 5 Years\\n\\n Operating leases\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n1,760\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n195\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n409\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n368\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n788\\n\\n Purchase obligations\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5,378\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n5,378\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\n Asset retirement obligations\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n28\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n8\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n7\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n13\\n\\n Other obligations\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n471\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n242\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n124\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n105\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\x97\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n Total\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa07,637\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa05,815\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0541\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0480\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n$\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0801\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n Lease Commitments  As of September\\xa027, 2008, the Company had total outstanding commitments on noncancelable operating leases of $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion of which related to the lease of retail space and related facilities. The Company\\x92s major\\nfacility leases are generally for terms of 3 to 20 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of 1 to 5 additional years. Leases for retail space are for terms of 5 to 20 years, the majority of which are for 10 years, and often contain\\nmulti-year renewal options.  Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers  The Company utilizes several contract manufacturers to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\\x92s products and to perform final assembly and test of finished\\nproducts. These contract manufacturers acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual components for its\\nproducts from a wide variety of individual suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based on projected demand information. Such\\npurchase commitments typically cover the Company\\x92s forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days. In addition, the Company has an off-balance sheet warranty obligation for products accounted for\\nunder subscription accounting pursuant to SOP No.\\xa097-2 whereby the Company recognizes warranty expense as incurred. As of September\\xa027, 2008, the Company had outstanding off-balance sheet third-party manufacturing commitments, component\\npurchase commitments, and estimated warranty commitments of $5.4 billion.  During 2006, the Company entered into long-term supply agreements with Hynix\\nSemiconductor, Inc., Intel Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and Toshiba Corporation to secure supply of NAND flash memory through calendar year 2010. As part of these agreements, the Company prepaid $1.25 billion\\nfor flash memory components during 2006, which will be applied to certain inventory purchases made over the life of each respective agreement. The Company utilized $567 million of the prepayment as of September\\xa027, 2008.  Asset Retirement Obligations  The Company\\x92s asset retirement\\nobligations are associated with commitments to return property subject to operating leases to original condition upon lease termination. As of September\\xa027, 2008, the Company estimated that gross expected future cash flows of $28 million would\\nbe required to fulfill these obligations.  \\xa0\\n50 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\nOther Obligations  Other outstanding obligations were $471 million as of September\\xa027, 2008, which related to advertising, research and development, Internet and telecommunications services, and other obligations.  During the first quarter of 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FIN 48. The Company had historically classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax\\nbenefits as current liabilities, but beginning with the adoption of FIN 48 the Company has reclassified gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as\\nnon-current liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of September\\xa027, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits of $506 million and gross interest and penalties of $219 million, both of which are classified as\\nnon-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes; therefore,\\nsuch amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.  Indemnifications  The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and application software against legal claims that the software infringes third-party\\nintellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim against the Company or an\\nindemnified third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not have a\\nliability related to unresolved infringement claims subject to indemnification that would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of\\neither September\\xa027, 2008 or September\\xa029, 2007.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency Risk Management  The Company\\nregularly reviews its foreign exchange forward and option positions, both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures. However, given the effective horizons of the Company\\x92s\\nrisk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures, there can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition,\\nthe timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may\\nadversely affect the Company\\x92s financial condition and operating results.  Interest Rate Risk  While the Company is exposed to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world\\x92s leading industrialized countries, the Company\\x92s interest income and expense is\\nmost sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. As such, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company\\x92s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, the value of those investments,\\nas well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges.  The Company\\x92s short-term investment policy and strategy attempts primarily to preserve\\ncapital and meet liquidity requirements. A portion of the Company\\x92s cash is managed by external managers within the guidelines of the Company\\x92s investment policy and to an objective market benchmark. The Company\\x92s internal portfolio\\nis benchmarked against external manager performance, allowing for differences in liquidity needs.  The Company\\x92s exposure to market risk for changes in\\ninterest rates relates primarily to the Company\\x92s investment portfolio. The Company typically invests in highly rated securities and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company\\x92s investment\\npolicy requires investments to be rated single-A or better with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. All highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase are classified as\\ncash \\n \\xa0\\n51 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nequivalents, while highly liquid investments with initial maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are classified as short-term\\ninvestments. As of September\\xa027, 2008 and September\\xa029, 2007, approximately $2.4 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, of the Company\\x92s short-term investments had underlying maturities ranging from one to five years. The remainder\\nall had underlying maturities of less than 12 months. The Company may sell its investments prior to their stated maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized no\\nmaterial net gains or losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006 related to such sales.  To provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with\\nthe Company\\x92s investment portfolio, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of the investment portfolio assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in the yield\\ncurve. Based on investment positions as of September\\xa027, 2008, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities would result in a $46 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. As of\\nSeptember\\xa029, 2007, a similar 100 basis point shift in the yield curve would have resulted in a $16 million incremental decline in the fair market value of the portfolio. Such losses would only be realized if the Company sold the investments\\nprior to maturity.  Foreign Currency Risk  In general,\\nthe Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, will negatively affect the Company\\x92s net sales and gross margins as expressed\\nin U.S. dollars. There is also a risk that the Company will have to adjust local currency product pricing due to competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.  The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing\\nassets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\\x92s practice is to hedge a majority of its material foreign exchange exposures,\\ntypically for three to six months. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality, prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures, and limited availability of appropriate hedging\\ninstruments.  To provide a meaningful assessment of the foreign currency risk associated with certain of the Company\\x92s foreign currency derivative\\npositions, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value-at-risk (\\x93VAR\\x94) model to assess the potential impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. The VAR model consisted of using a Monte Carlo simulation to generate 3,000\\nrandom market price paths. The VAR is the maximum expected loss in fair value, for a given confidence interval, to the Company\\x92s foreign exchange portfolio due to adverse movements in rates. The VAR model is not intended to represent actual\\nlosses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based on\\nthe results of the model, the Company estimates with 95% confidence a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $60 million as of September\\xa027, 2008 compared to a maximum one-day loss in fair value of $13 million as of September\\xa029, 2007.\\nBecause the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred on those instruments are generally offset by increases in the fair value of the underlying exposures.  Actual future gains and losses associated with the Company\\x92s investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses\\nperformed as of September\\xa027, 2008 due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company\\x92s actual exposures and positions.\\n \\xa0\\n52 \\n\\n\\nTable of Contents'"
