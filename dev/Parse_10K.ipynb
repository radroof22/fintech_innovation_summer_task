      "sections of MD&A, as well as a few helpful hints for reading these pages. MD&A includes the following sections: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Our Business  a general description of our business; the value drivers of our business; measurements; and\n",
      "opportunities, challenges and risks.\n",
      "Financial Strategies and Risk Management  information about debt financing, share repurchases, dividend policy\n",
      "and financial risk management.\n",

      "and estimates.\n",
      "Operations Review  an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented\n",
      "in our financial statements. Our Company operates in one business  nonalcoholic beverages. Except to the extent that differences between our five geographic operating segments are\n",
      "material to an understanding of our business as a whole, we present the discussion in this MD&A on a consolidated basis.\n",
      "Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position  an analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash,\n",
      "contractual obligations, and financial position.\n",
      "Forward-Looking Statements  cautionary information about forward-looking statements and a description of certain\n",

      "Our Business \n",

      "        We are the world's largest beverage company, with four of the world's top five soft-drink brandsCoca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta\n",
      "and Sprite. Because we believe in offering choices, we provide a wide variety of nonalcoholic beverages to meet consumers' desires and needs. Our Company owns or licenses nearly 400 trademarked\n",
      "brandsincluding carbonated soft drinks, juices and juice drinks, sports drinks, water products, teas, coffees and other beverages. Finished beverage products bearing our trademarks are\n",
      "sold in more than 200 countries. \n",
      "        Our\n",
      "Company generates revenues, income and cash flows by manufacturing and selling beverage concentrates and syrups as well as some finished beverages. We generally sell these products\n",
      "to bottling and canning operations, distributors, fountain wholesalers and some fountain retailers. We authorize our bottling partners to manufacture and package products made from our concentrates\n",
      "and syrups into branded finished products, that they then distribute and sell. Bottling partners, in which our Company has no ownership interest or a noncontrolling ownership interest, produced and\n",
      "distributed 82 percent of our 2003 worldwide unit case volume. \n",
      "        We\n",
      "make significant marketing expenditures in support of our brands, including advertising costs, sponsorship fees and special promotional events. Retailers and distributors receive\n",
      "rebates, promotions and point-of-sale displays. Our bottling partners receive advertising support and funds designated for cold-drink equipment. Consumers receive\n",
      "coupons, discounts and promotional incentives. These marketing expenditures \n",
      "22\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "help\n",
      "to enhance awareness of and increase consumer preference for our brands. Greater awareness and preference promotes long-term growth in profitable volume, per capita consumption and\n",
      "our share of worldwide nonalcoholic beverage sales. \n",
      "        Our\n",
      "Company articulates its mission as a promise: Our Company exists to benefit and refresh everyone it touches. More specifically,\n",
      "through our actions we strive every day to provide quality in the marketplace, enrich the workplace, preserve the environment and strengthen our communities. Building upon the foundation of our\n",
      "promise, we focus on the six strategic priorities discussed in Item 1 of this report. \n",
      "\n",
      " Value Drivers of Our Business \n",
      "\n",
      "        We believe that executing our six strategic priorities creates value. Consistent with a commitment to effective execution, our Company focuses on three key value\n",
      "drivers: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "profitable\n",
      "growth;\n",
      "cost\n",
      "management; and\n",
      "efficient\n",
      "capital structure. \n",
      "\n",
      "        Profitable Growth.    We believe healthy brandsproperly supported by marketing and\n",
      "innovation, leveraged across markets and targeted to a broad consumer basedrive profitable growth. Our Company continues to broaden our family of brands. In particular, we are expanding\n",
      "and growing our noncarbonated offerings to provide more alternatives to consumers. With this expansion and growth, our Company is focused on maintaining or increasing profit margins. We further intend\n",
      "to focus on improving\n",
      "margins in faster growing but lower-margin countries. To manage this expansion and growth, we are shifting from a volume focus to a \"volume and value\" focus. The added emphasis on value focuses on\n",
      "gross profit and profit before taxes. To support this shift, beginning in 2003 our compensation incentives emphasize gross profit, profit before income taxes and net income instead of unit case\n",
      "volume. We believe that tailored brand, package, price and channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies and accelerating profitable growth through close\n",
      "alignment with our bottling partners. \n",
      "        Cost Management.    A principal focus of cost management will continue to be on supply chain\n",
      "initiatives. Over the past year in North America, Japan and China, the Coca-Cola System established supply chain management companies to help increase procurement efficiencies and to\n",
      "centralize production and logistics operations. Lowering supply chain costs improves system economics. Alignment with all bottlers, including ways to achieve additional joint savings, represents a\n",
      "critical area of focus. \n",
      "        Cost\n",
      "reduction is another key initiative. One key area of focus, for example, is to decrease over time general and administrative costs as a percentage of net operating revenues. In\n",
      "2003, we took steps to streamline and simplify our operations. Refer to Note 17. As a result of these streamlining initiatives, apart from the charge to 2003 earnings of $561 million, we\n",
      "estimate that the Company's financial results benefited by approximately $50 million (pretax) in 2003 and will benefit by at least $100 million (pretax) on an annualized basis beginning\n",
      "in 2004. \n",
      "        Efficient Capital Structure.    Our capital structure is intended to optimize our cost of capital. We\n",
      "believe our strong capital position, our access to key financial markets, our ability to raise funds at a low effective cost and our overall low cost of borrowing provide a competitive advantage. \n",
      "        As\n",
      "our cash flows increase, we expect to increase our share repurchases. Furthermore, dividends increased for the 42nd straight year in 2004, and we believe that for the foreseeable\n",
